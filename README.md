# Rockin Synth

As I no longer have an actual piano to reference for looks, I also have to thank [LFeh](https://github.com/LFeh/). I used his keyboard as a visual reference. I also wasn't able to find any mp3 notes for the piano sounds, so I have **LFeh** to thank for that too.
To learn more about his project, please visit the [piano](https://github.com/LFeh/piano) repo.

This **keyboard** is meant to be played by pressing down **Computer keys**. That means on a laptop or desktop, or any other device that has a keyboard hooked up to it.
