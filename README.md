This project was inspired by the project I created called JavaScript Drumkit. That project is part of a series called JavaScript30, created by WesBos.

As I no longer have an actual piano to reference for looks, I also have to thank <a href="https://github.com/LFeh/">LFeh</a>. I used his keyboard as a visual reference. I also wasn't able to find any mp3 notes for the piano sounds (the ones from WesBos' project would not do), so I have LFeh to thank for that too.

This keyboard is meant to be played by pressing down Computer keys. That means on a laptop or desktop, or any other device that has a keyboard hooked up to it.
